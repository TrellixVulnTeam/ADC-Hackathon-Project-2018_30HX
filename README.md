1. Mortuary Vans are largely not available across states and it becomes extremely disappointing if the vans are not available to take dead bodies from hospitals to their respective homes.
2. Though there are vans which are available in private space however there is no single point of contact through which services of these vans could be requested when in need.
3. It is expected that technology can bring all that data in once place and help users and health system to request these services whenever a death is reported in the hospital. 
The service could be accessed by various means such as miss call, mobile app, sms or call to a central number.
